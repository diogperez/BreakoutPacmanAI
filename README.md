BreakoutPacmanAI: Evolving a Feed-Forward Neural Network to control Breakout and Pacman

This project was developed for the Artificial Intelligence course (LEI 2023/24) at ISCTE-IUL.

It applies a feed-forward neural network optimized through a genetic algorithm to play simplified versions of the classic arcade games Breakout and Pacman. The neural network is evolved over generations to maximize performance in each game.

The project is implemented in Java and includes separate modules for the neural network, genetic algorithm, and game controllers for both Breakout and Pacman.
